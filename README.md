  This GitHub account is being utilized to practice various
  programming languages and become a more proficient practitioner.
  
  My current focus is on front-end development. My education is

  well rounded full stack developer.
  
  Any and all feedback is welcomed, thank you for your time
  and happy coding!
  
Very Repsectfully,
