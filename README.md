  This GitHub account is being utilized to practice various
  programming languages and become a more proficient practitioner.
  
  My current focus is on front-end and iOS Development. My education is 
  focused mainly on back-end JAVA and Python, so I'm seeking to broaden my horizons and become more well rounded.
  
  Any and all feedback is welcomed, thank you for your time
  and happy coding!
  
Very Repsectfully,
